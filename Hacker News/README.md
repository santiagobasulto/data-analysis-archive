Most of my HN analysis are performed on my own dataset, which is a dump of all HN posts (+600MB). I scraped it using Algolia using a quick Python library I wrote: https://github.com/santiagobasulto/python-hacker-news

The dataset is available (fairly updated) on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/santiagobasulto/all-hacker-news-posts-stories-askshow-hn-polls
